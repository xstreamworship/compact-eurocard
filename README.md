Compact EuroCard (CEC) is an adaptation of EuroCard specifications (IEC-60297-3-101) intended for digital modular music synthesis as well as related and other control applications.  The distinguishing features are to use half depth 100mm by 80mm cards suitable for purpose built MCU and SoC based modules but to maintain compatibility with EuroRack.
